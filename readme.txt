1. sort
selection sort
inserting sort
shell's sort
merge sort
        from up to down
        from down to up
fast sort
        fast sort
        position filling sort
        Dijkstra sort
        heap sort
              from up to down
              from down to up
linear time sort
     count sort

2. search
    binary search
    binary search tree
    2-3 search tree
    (2-3 tree is a kind of balance tree whose degree is 3)
    balanced tree
    (balanced tree stores data and key in all nodes)
    B+ tree
    (B+ tree  stores all data in leaf nodes and uses a linked list to link all the leaf nodes)
    red-black tree
    (a red-black tree equals to a 2-3 tree and also equals to a binary tree)

    algorithm: 
           create/traverse/show a 2-3/B/B+ tree
           get the depth/number of leaf nodes of a 2-3/B/B+ tree
           insert/delete/update/get key=>value into/from a 2-3/B/B+ tree
